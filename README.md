## Indended Purpose

My wife is a Ph.D candidate studying how the judiciary impacts a child's health outcome. Little reasearch has been collected to evaluate how judges rule on an individual per judge basis. This project is intended to solve this in three steps:

1. Submission of custody order & data to google sheets

2. Validation of custody order within google sheets

3. Presentation of data to website

## Phase 1: This Assignment

## Phase 2: Hosting

## Phase 3: Interactive Data

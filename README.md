# Simple-Upload

This website uploads files to google drive. Because the conditions of this assignment is limited to hosting via GitHub pages, this will not have a backend facilitating the uploads working.

## Indended Purpose

My wife is a Ph.D candidate studying how the judiciary impacts a child's health outcome. Little reasearch has been collected to evaluate how judges rule on an individual per judge basis. This project is intended to have unadulterated data available to the public to serve as a public good. Users to the website should be able to evaluate judges against knowns (i.e., research, other judges, other court systems, etc). The intent is that this will serve as a source of societal pressure for judges to make better rulings.

This will be solved in three steps:

1. Submission of custody order & data to google sheets

2. Validation of custody order within google sheets

3. Presentation of data to website

## Phase 1: This Assignment
